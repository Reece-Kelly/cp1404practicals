# What did you see on line 1?
# I saw  a random number between 5 and 20 print

# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# The smallest number I could've seen was 5 and the largest was 20

# What did you see on line 2?
# I saw a random number print between 3 and 10 but only the odd numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9

# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# The smallest number I could've seen was 3 and the largest was 9 because the increment was 2 meaning that 10 could not
# have been printed

# Could line 2 have produced a 4?
# No, because the increment was set to 2 and you cannot get 4 by adding 2 to 3

# What did you see on line 3?
# I saw a random real number between 2.5 and 5.5 print

# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# The smallest number would be 2.5 and the largest would be 5.5
