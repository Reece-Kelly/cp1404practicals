1. I found that I always spent more time on a task that I estimated at the beginning. I would say that my estimation
accuracy improved marginally throughout the subject but I always found my estimate was too small compared to the actual
amount of time I would spend on a task.

2. I learned how to politely suggest code improvements to the person that I was interviewing. I've also learned better
code practices such as including doc strings for all my functions and methods. Knowing that a person is going to review
my code improved my attention to detail as I wanted everything to be correct.

3. If I were in charge of the subject I would make larger practicals worth more marks than smaller ones. For example, I
might make the large week 7 practical worth 15% of the practical marks and the small week 1 practical worth 5% of all 
practical marks.
